    <h5>UofT Course Info Chrome Extension. Developed by Murad Akhundov in 2017-2018.</h5>
    <p>Source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/MuradAkh">Github</a></p>
    <p><u>NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO</u></p>

    <p>
        Data for courses is provided by <a href="https://cobalt.qas.im/">Cobalt API</a>. Discount Textbook Store data
        was scrapped from a pdf file available on their website. Department website links were scrapped from UofT
        directory.
